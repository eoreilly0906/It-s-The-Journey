## How It's Made:
Using Typescript to run the node project directly from the terminal! 
Made with VS Code it is hard coded for amazing interactivity!



**Tech used:**  JavaScript, Node, Typescript, Love and affection



## Lessons Learned:
Oh boy. Well let's see, I pulled my hair out trying to implment the towing option for the truck. 
The same with the importing the wheels. There was a lot of anwsers within the code that was given and 
gave me a starting point that was really helpful. The biggest take away was going one by one with the TODOS.
And LOTS of googling.
